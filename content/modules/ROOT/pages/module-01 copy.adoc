[[create_project]]
== Create a New Project

. Before creating a VM we need to create a new project. Virtual machines are deployed to a specific project, or namespace, where by default, users without permission to the namespace cannot access, manage, or control them. Administrators can access all projects, and therefore view all virtual machines, however regular users must be given access to projects as needed.
+
. Click *Create Project* at the top right of the console.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/10_Column_Create.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. In the *Name* field, type *vmexamples-userX* to name the project, then click *Create*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/11_Create_Project.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
NOTE: The virtual machine overview column is changed to view this new project immediately, but it does not currently show up in the center column as there are no VMs in the project and we the option to not show it is toggled on by default.


[[create_vm]]
== Create a Linux Virtual Machine

. From the virtual machine overview column, click on the *Create VirtualMachine* button and select *From template* from the drop-down menu.
+
NOTE: VMs can also be created from an InstanceType wizard as well as created by entering a custom YAML definition, but for this current lab scenario we are going to stick with creating VMs based on existing templates.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/12_Create_VM_Button.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. You will be taken to the *Catalog* screen, where a number of tiles will appear showing the available pre-defined VM templates.
+
Reviewing the list of available templates youâ€™ll notice that some have a blue badge which indicates _Source available_. These are templates which are using automatically downloaded and stored template source disks. 
+
If you were deploying in your own environment where you can customize the options available, you can choose to modify the availability of these boot sources by default, and/or remove these source disks, in favor of creating custom disks for your organization's needs.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/13_Create_VM_Templates.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Select the *Fedora VM* tile, and a dialog opens.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/14_Create_VM_Quick.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Change the name to *fedora01* and press *Quick create VirtualMachine*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/15_Create_VM_Quick_Name.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. We will return to our tree view and see information about our new VM in the virtual machine overview column. Notice also that we now see our *vmexamples-userX* project listed in the center column as it contains a VM, and that it is highlighted within the project.
+
If we watch closely we can see the VM Status switch from *Provisioning* to *Starting* and finally *Running* in the virtual machine overview column when it is ready. 
+
During this time, the storage provider has cloned the template disk so that it can be used by the newly created virtual machine. The amount of time this takes can vary based on the storage provider being used to create the boot disk, and the current load on the system.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/16_Fedora_Running.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Once the virtual machine is running we can do some further exploration of the *Overview* page in the right side column.  
+
* *Details*: This tile shows us information about our VM, including it's name, status, creation time, OS, virtual resources, and the template from which it was created. It also contains a minature VNC terminal, and the ability to launch a fullscreen web console.
* *General*: This tile shows us information specific to OpenShift, including the Namespace (Project), instance name, and Kubernetes pod where the guest is running.
* *Snapshots*: This tile gives us information about any existing snapshots, and also has the button to quickly create a snapshot.
* *Network*: This tile gives us the IP address of the virtual machine on the software-defined network (SDN) and it's internal hostname. If no advanced networks are defined, VMs are automatically attached to the pod network. Later in this lab we will explore advanced networking options, and how to customize connectivity for VMs.
* *Utilization*: This tile gives us an overview of the resources currently in use by this virtual machine, including CPU, Memory, Storage, and Network throughput.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/17_Fedora_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. After you are done looking at the VM details, click the *Events* tab to see some details of the provisioning process that just took place. If there are any issues with the creation of the VM, they will show up on this tab as well. The following events took place during creation:
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/18_Fedora_Events.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
* A _DataVolume_ was created. _DataVolumes_ are used to manage the creation of a VM disk, abstracting the clone or import process onto OpenShift native storage during the virtual machine's creation workflow.
* The new  _VM instance_ Fedora01 has been started.

[[admin_vms]]
== Administering Virtual Machines

Administering and using virtual machines is more than simply creating and customizing their configuration. As the platform administrator, we also need to be able to control the VM states and trigger live migrations so that we can balance resources, perform maintenance tasks, and reconfigure nodes.

. Click the *Configuration* tab, this is the entry point to obtain more information about, and modify the resources of the virtual machine.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/19_VM_Configuration.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
It includes seven subtabs:
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/20_Configuration_Tab.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
* *Details*: This tab presents all of the physical features of the VM in a single panel. From here you can make edits to various descriptors and basic hardware configurations including modifying the cpu or memory, changing the hostname, attaching passthrough devices, and modifying the boot order.
* *Storage*: This tab lists the disks attached to the system and allows you to add new disks to the system. If the guest is configured with the agent, it lists the filesystems and the utilization. Here it is possible to attach _ConfigMaps_, _Secrets_, and _Service Accounts_ as extra disks. This is useful when passing configuration data to the application(s) running in the virtual machine.
* *Network*: This Tab shows the current network interfaces configured for the VM and allows for you to add new ones.
* *Scheduling*: This tab includes advanced configuration options indicating where the VM should run and the strategy to follow for eviction. This tab is used to configure (anti)affinity rules, configure node selectors and tolerations, and other behaviors that affect which cluster nodes the VM can be scheduled to.
* *SSH*: This tab allows you to configure remote access to the machine by creating an SSH service on a configured load-balancer, or by injecting public SSH keys if the feature is enabled.
* *Initial run*: This tab allows us to configure _cloud-init_ for Linux or _sys-prep_ for Microsoft Windows, including setting the commands to be executed on the first boot, such as the injection of SSH keys, installation of applications, network configuration, and more.
* *Metadata*: This tab shows current Labels and Annotations applied to the virtual machine. Modifying these values can help us tag our machines for specific purposes, or help us enable automated workflows by uniquely identifying machines.

. You can click on each of these to explore at your leisure, but for introductory purposes, lets focus on storage and networking specifically.

. List the disks associated with the VM by clicking on the *Storage* tab:
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/21_Storage_Tab.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
In this environment, the default StorageClass, which defines the source and type of storage used for the disk, is called *ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd*. This storage is the default type provided by OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) for running virtual machines. Each storage provider has different storage classes that define the characteristics of the storage backing the VM disk.

. Examine the network interfaces attached to the VM by clicking on the *Network* subtab:
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/22_Network_Tab.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
When a VM is created, an interface on the *Pod Networking* network of type *masquerade* is created by default. This connects the VM to the SDN and provides access from the VM to outside the OpenShift cluster. Other VMs, and Pods, in the cluster can access the virtual machine using this interface.
+
Furthermore, a VM connected to the SDN can be accessed externally using a Route, or Service with type load balancer, or even have a Network Attachment Definition configured to allow direct access to external networks, a concept we will explore in more depth later.

[[vm_state]]
== Controlling Virtual Machine State

As a user with granted permissions to manage a  Virtualization environment: you can stop, start, restart, pause, and unpause virtual machines from the web console.

. Click the *Overview* tab to return to the summary screen.

. In the top right corner you will notice shortcut buttons for running state: stop, restart, pause, and start. As well as a dropdown menu title *Actions*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/23_VM_State_Actions.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
* *Stop*: Starts a graceful shutdown of the Virtual Machine.
* *Restart*: This will send a signal to the operating system to reboot the Virtual Machine. Guest integrations are needed for this to work properly.
* *Pause*: The process is frozen without further access to CPU resources and I/O, but the memory used by the VM at the hypervisor level will stay allocated.
* *Start*: Starts up a stopped virtual machine. It will be greyed out if the machine is running.

. While the shortcut buttons are handy, you can also access these options and more by clicking on the *Actions* menu and seeing the options available in the drop down list.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/24_VM_Actions_Menu.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Press the *Stop* button and wait until the Virtual Machine is in state *Stopped*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/25_VM_Stopped.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Clicking on *Actions*, the option *Start* appears, and the options *Restart* and *Pause* are greyed out.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/26_VM_Actions_List_Stopped.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click *Start*, and wait for the *Running* status.

. Using the *Actions* menu, or the shortcut button, press the *Pause* option. The Virtual Machine state will change to *Paused*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/27_VM_Actions_Paused.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Unpause the Virtual Machine using the *Actions* menu and the option *Unpause*, or by using the shortcut button.

[[live_migrate]]
== Live Migrate a Virtual Machine

In this section, we will migrate the VM from one OpenShift node to another without shutting down the VM. Live migration requires *ReadWriteMany* (RWX) storage so that the VM disks can be mounted on both the source and destination nodes at the same time. OpenShift Virtualization, unlike other virtualization solutions that you may be familiar with, does not use monolithic datastores mounted to each cluster member that hold many VM disks for many different VMs. Instead, each VM disk is stored in its own volume that is only mounted when and where it's needed.

. To see the physical node that the virtual machine is running on, click on the *Pod* name _virt-launcher-fedora01-uuid_ found under the *General* tile on the *Overview* page.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/28_Pod_Name.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. This will bring up the Pod details page. Search for the section header called *Node* and see the name of the worker that the pod is running on. In this screenshot it is running on _worker-cluster-ttgmt-3_.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/29_Pod_Details_Node.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click the back button in your browser to return to the *Overview* page. 

. Using the *Actions* menu, select the option for *Migration* -> *Compute*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/30_VM_Dialog_Migrate.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. After a few seconds, the VM will change the status to *Migrating*, and you can follow it's progress. 
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/31_VM_Migrating.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. When the migration is complete the VM will return to the *Running* status, but it will be living on a new node. Let's click on our _virt-launcher-fedora01-uuid_ pod name to verify.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/32_Migrated_Status.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. We can now see that the virtual machine is living on a new node, in the image _worker-cluster-ttgmt-2_, and that the pod itself now resides in a new pod with a new unique ID as the live migration process transfers the VM instance to a new pod on a new worker node nondisruptively.
+

== Summary

In this lab, we did an overview of the Virtualization management environment in OpenShift Virtualization, and performed some basic virtual machine management tasks, including state management and live migration between physical hosts. Both of these are common and often necessary tasks as platform administrators and a great way to familiarize yourself with some basic features available when working with VMs in OpenShift Virtualization.
